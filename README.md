If you have make install then use this command for making the cpp files into obj files or executable ones.
```cmd
make
```
Then to remove just use this instead of manually removing it just use this.
```cmd
make clean
```
Then for each executable file use this
```cmd
./server
```
and
```cmd
./client 127.0.0.1
```
why you might ask 127.0.0.1 it is the localhost so it works. now if you are facing bind error you could manually free the ip via 
```cmd
netstat -tulp TCP
```
or
```terminal
exit
```
